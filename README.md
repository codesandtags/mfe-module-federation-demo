# Module Federation Demo for Micro Frontends

## Motivation

After review in multiples articles, websites and trending topics talking about Webpack Module Federation, I've decided to review in details this topic and gain my own experience. The result of this project is based on [Microfrontends course by Stephen Grider](https://www.udemy.com/course/microfrontend-course). This project intends to support some part of the main challenges in Micro frontends:

* Runtime integration
* Shared dependencies
* Independent projects
* Shared styles
* Efficient resolution of dependencies and optimized bundles
* Deployment
* Authentication
